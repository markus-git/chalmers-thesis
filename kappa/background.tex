\chapter{Background}
\label{background}

High demands for efficiency under resource constraints have greatly influenced the development of embedded systems, both in terms of programming practice and architecture. Today, we see embedded systems consisting of everything between general purpose processors and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

% Processors are highly programmable systems but often inefficient in terms of power consumption and performance. In contrast, ASICs implement a fixed function and can therefore provide good power and performance characteristics, but any changes to its functionality requires a new circuit to be designed. 

Processors and ASICs represent two extremes of available architectures, where field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have found a good middle-ground and provides the best of both worlds: they are close to hardware and can be reprogrammed~\cite{bacon2013}. A modern FPGA also contain various discrete components and co-processors, which together with their good performance per Watt ratio, have seen them increasingly used in high-performance, computationally intensive systems~\cite{mcmillan2014}.

% FPGAs typically consists of a large array of configurable logic blocks, connected by programmable interconnects.

While modern FPGAs show great promise as a prototypical system for heterogeneous computing, their adoption has been slowed by the fact that they're difficult to program. Their logic blocks are usually programmed in a hardware description language, while the embedded processors are programmed in a low level dialect of C or even assembler. Furthermore, the various components of a modern FPGA may support different intrinsics, leading to incompatibilities between the code they can execute even if they are programmed in the same language.

% The use of low level languages is primarily driven by the desire to access the full potential of a processor or its memory system. However, such languages also forces its developers to focus on low level implementation details rather than the high level specification of the algorithm they are implementing.

% and accelerators

% In the design of a heterogeneous systems there is concerns related to any dissimilarities between the embedded components that needs to be address. Components may support different instructions, leading to incompatibilities between the code they can execute even if they're both programmed in the same language. Even the implementation of language features, such as functions, may differ between components. In addition to instructions, components may interpret memory in different ways and have access to various cache structures. These differences imply that a heterogeneous system may have components that are similar in architecture, but have low-level differences that lead to variations in performance and power consumption.

One of the benefits of low level code is that it gives programmers fine control over the aforementioned system capabilities and differences thereof. However, this control comes at a cost, as the programmers must exercise this right during the entire design process. So the problem of implementing an algorithm has become a problem of implementing an algorithm for a specific component.

The issues above issues with low level languages are magnified for heterogeneous systems, as the developer must specify both its hardware and software parts and how they communicate; ideally she would like to experiment with various choices of what to put in hardware and what in software. Low-level languages provide little support for such design exploration, and rewriting code intended for component to another is typically a major undertaking.

Many of the issues faced in heterogeneous computing with low level languages like C and HDLs stem from a lack of abstractions. Some of these languages modularity problems come as a direct result of the fine grained control they provide, as it will inevitably tie programs to the architecture of its system. Some issues of, for instance, functionality and architecture come as a indirect consequence of the lack of abstractions. Ideally, such issues would be treated separately, as it allows us to create small, reusable libraries that provide solutions to these issues, and then combine them in a modular fashion to solve larger problems.

% For instance, we would like to treat functionality like parallelism as a separate design decision. In imperative languages like C, this is however quite difficult to do. On the other hand, HDLs assume programs are parallel by default, and extra care has to be taken when ordering operations.

% Issues with differences in language design between C and HDLs can also be ascribed to a lack of abstractions. Ideally, issues of functionality, architecture or parallelism would be treated separately. As being able to do so would allow us to create reusable libraries that provide solutions to these issues, and then combine them in a modular fashion to solve problems.

\section{Functional Programming}
\label{functional}

Functional programming, as the name implies, is based around the application of functions to its arguments. In this programming style, programs are written as functions that accept input and delivers its result. These functions are themselves defined in terms of smaller functions, which in turn are defined using smaller functions still and, in the end, a function consists of language primitives such as built-in functions, variables or constants.

An important distinction between functions in a functional programming language and, say an imperative language like C, is that functions always return the same value when given same arguments. More generally, we say that functional programs have no side effects and their definitions and evaluation are thus separated; functions can safely be evaluated in parallel as long at their data dependencies are satisfied.

A function that accepts other functions as arguments is often referred to as a higher-order function, or a combinator, and provide a useful piece of glue code that lets programmers build complex functions from smaller ones. In Haskell, a functional programming language, a number of such higher-order functions that implement common operations are provided by its standard libraries. One such function is \codei{map} and it can be defined as follows:

\begin{code}
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
\end{code}

The first line specifies the type of \codei{map}, because in Haskell, every function is assigned a static type in an effort to attain safer programs. If you by mistake write a program that tries to multiply some integer by a boolean type, it won't even compile and instead warns you about the type error. As for the types themselves, they are a kind of label that every expression has and states what category of operations that the expression belongs in.

A function's type comes after the \codei{::} sign, and in the case of \codei{map}, tells us that its first argument is a function \codei{f :: a -> b} which, given an argument of type \codei{a}, produces a result of type \codei{b}. In addition to the function, \codei{map} also takes a list \codei{xs :: [a]} of element with type \codei{a}, and returns another list of elements with type \codei{b}. As functions cannot have any side effects, we can already make a guess at what this function does and claim that it applies \codei{f} to every element of \codei{xs}.

The second and third line of \codei{map} validates our earlier guess and lists the full definition of the function. Firstly, it says that given an empty list, shown as \codei{[]}, the result is another empty list---there's simply nothing to apply \codei{f} to. Secondly, in the case where \codei{map} is given a non-empty list \codei{x:xs} where \codei{x} is the list head and \codei{xs} its tail, it applies \codei{f} to \codei{x} and concatenates its result with the list made from a recursive call to itself on \codei{xs}.

The other piece of glue code that functional programming languages provides is often referred to as function composition, and enables programs to be glued together. Say that \codei{f} and \codei{g} are two programs, then \codei{g} composed with \codei{f} is written \codei{g <> f} and is a program that, when applied to its input \codei{x}, computes \codei{g (f x)}. In Haskell, we can define function composition as:

\begin{code}
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
(.) g f x = g (f x)
\end{code}

\noindent where parenthesis around the dot implies that function composition is an infix function. While the size of the intermediate result of \codei{f} could spoil the usefulness of composition, functional programming solves this by only evaluating \codei{f} as much as is needed by \codei{g}. This property is referred to as lazy evaluation.

Lazy evaluation in Haskell isn't limited to its own functions and values, but extends to functions written in embedded languages as well, like that of our co-design library. For these functions, the laziness of its functions means that only the parts that contribute to the end result will be part of function, that is, no unnecessary code will generated or evaluated for a program.

The other piece of glue code in Haskell, that is, its combinators, are also usable for any embedded functions. This means that we can create programs whose operation is determined by the functions provided by its arguments. For example, we could write a hardware design in our co-design library that changes size according to the kind of inputs or operations it uses.

So far, we have looked at a few Haskell functions as an introduction to functional programming and talked a bit about how its beneficial properties can help embedded languages. We have yet to make the distinction between regular and embedded Haskell functions. The following section introduces the concept of domain specific languages, and explains what explains what it entails to be an embedded domain specific language in Haskell.

\section{Domain Specific Languages}
\label{domain}

A domain specific language (DSL) is a special-purpose language, tailored to a certain problem and captures the concepts and operations in its domain. For instance, a hardware designer might write in VHDL, while a web-designer that wants to create an interactive web-page would use JavaScript. Both use a language that is specialized to the particular task they have at hand, and both build programs in a form that is familiar to regular programmers; VHDL and JavaScript are both examples of a DSL.

DSLs comes in two fundamentally different forms: external and internal. An external DSL is a first-class language, with its own compiler or interpreter, and often comes with its own ecosystem. The previous VHDL and JavaScript examples both fall into the domain of external DSLs. Internal DSLs are embedded in a host language, and are often referred to as embedded domain specific languages (EDSLs).

% Embedded languages can have the look and feel of a stand-alone language, but reuse many parts of the host-language's ecosystem and semantics to lower the cost to develop and maintain them.

Haskell, with its static type system, flexible overloading and lazy semantics, has seen itself as host for a range of EDSLs. For instance, popular libraries for parsing, pretty printing, hardware design and testing have all been embedded in Haskell. These embedded languages come in two different flavors, where the most common one is called shallow embedding and is represented by functions that implements the semantics of the embedded language.

We illustrate how shallow embeddings work in Haskell through a small example over integral expressions:

\begin{code}
type Exp = Int

const :: Int -> Exp
const a = a

times :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp
times a b = a * b
\end{code}

\noindent Expressions are defined as a type synonym for integers, making use of Haskell's \codei{type} keyword, and the language around our expressions is defined by two functions, one for integer literals, called \codei{const} and another for multiplication, called \codei{times}. Note we could easily have added more functions, as long as they're part of the domain.

% Notice that, as , we could add more functions quite easily as long as they're part of the domain.

The advantage of a shallow type like \codei{Exp} is that we can quickly calculate its value:

\begin{code}
eval :: Exp -> Int
eval a = a
\end{code}

\noindent Shallowly embedded languages do however perform quite poorly if we wish to compile the language; functions only return values and provide no way to look at the representation of a program. To compile an embedded language it is better to use an intermediate representation for functions, which sits between Haskell and the compiled code. This technique is known as a deep embedding and its functions return an abstract syntax tree that represents the computed value instead of its result.

We reimplement our earlier, shallowly embedded language for integer expressions to make use of a deep embedding instead:

\begin{code}
data Exp = Const Int | Times Exp Exp
\end{code}

\noindent Expressions now contain two constructors, one for integer literals and another for multiplication of expressions---Haskell's \codei{data} keyword introduces a new type and its different constructors are separated by a pipe. These constructors forms what is often referred to as a syntax tree, and represents the computations behind an expression.

As the type of expressions have changed from being a synonym to a concrete type, we must also change the functions that comes with it:

% Because the previous incarnation of expressions supported literals and multiplication function, we have given our new data type two constructors that represent these two actions. The language around our expressions changes as we 

\begin{code}
const :: Int -> Exp
const a = Const a

times :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp
times a b = Times a b
\end{code}

\noindent The functions now return a representation of the result rather than the result itself. Because of this, we can't easily add new functions as we would first have to extend \codei{Exp}.

The syntax tree used for a deeply embedded type like \codei{Exp}, while inflexible compared to its shallow version, is what enables functions to inspect, modify, and interpret an expression in order to support, for example, their evaluation:

\begin{code}
eval :: Exp -> Int
eval (Const a)   = a
eval (Times a b) = (eval a) * (eval b)
\end{code}

\noindent Each line of \codei{eval} handles one of the two constructors in \codei{Exp}, translating them into their corresponding Haskell value. Evaluating an expression to its equivalent Haskell value is however not the only supported interpretation of expressions. In fact, we could just as well have compiled the same expression to, say, its corresponding C code.

% The one exception in this translation is variables, since they cannot be translated without knowing the context in which the expression is evaluated---we simply don't know what value it references. As a result, trying to evaluate an expression that contains open variables will yield an error.

% which lets us inspect a them rather than simply its result.

% While the representation of embedded language's syntax tree can become quite large and unwieldy as the set supported operations grows, it is necessary to have one if we would like to do any kind of transform over the representation, or if we wish to introduce another interpretation.

While the implementation of shallow and deep embedding are usually at odds, there has been work done in order to combine their benefits~\cite{svenningsson2012}. In our co-design language, we make use of such a combination of deep and shallow embeddings: the core syntax is implemented as a deep embedding, with user facing libraries as shallow embeddings on top. This mixture of embeddings means that our core language is easy to interpret, while the user-facing libraries are able to provide a nice syntax for their functions.

% The benefits of shallow and deeply embedded are both attractive to have for an EDSL, at least in the sense that a shallow embedding can easily add new language features and a deep embedding supports multiple interpretations.

Now that we have grasp of what domain specific languages in Haskell are and the ideas behind them, the next section will go through a larger example in order to showcase embedded programming in our co-design and signal libraries.

\section{Embedded Programming in Haskell}
\label{haskell}

Programming in a functional language like Haskell is different from the imperative style of programming where users express their program as a series of sequential steps. In Haskell, users write their program as a mathematical function, that is, a function from its inputs to its output. This is in contrast to the imperative style of programming, 

% done in C or the hardware descriptions written in VHDL

% Furthermore, functional programming is typically done compositionally, and its languages provide a rich of operators to support the composition of new functions from smaller ones.

As an example of the above differences, we'll consider a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, one of the two primary types of digital filters used in digital signal processing applications~\cite{oppenheim1989}. The mathematical definition of a FIR filter of rank $N$ is as follows:

% A FIR filter is a filter whose impulse response has a finite duration, since it eventually settles to zero.

% This is in contrast to infinite impulse response filters, the second filter of the two primary types of digital filters, which may have an infinite impulse response. 

\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation}
y_{n} = b_{0} x_{n} + b_{1} x_{n-1} + \cdots + b_{N} x_{n-N} = \sum_{i=0}^{N} b_{i} x_{n-i}
\end{equation}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent where $x$ and $y$ are the input and output signals, respectively, and $b_i$ is the value of the impulse response at time instant $i$. The inputs $x_{n-i}$ are sometimes referred to as ``taps'' as they tap into the input signal at various time instants. 

In an imperative language like C, we can implement the FIR filter as:

\begin{code}
void fir(int N, int L, double *b, double *x, double *y)
{
 int j, k;
 double tap[256];
 for(j=0; j<N; j++) tap[j] = 0.0;
 for(j=0; j<L; j++)
 {
  for(k=N; k>1; k--) tap[k-1] = tap[k-2];
  tap[0] = x[j];
  y[j] = 0.0;
  for(k=0; k<N; k++) y[j] += b[k] * tap[k];
 }
}
\end{code}

\noindent Here, $N$ is the filter rank, as before, and $L$ is the size of the input---we assume $N$ will be smaller than $256$. The three variables $b$, $x$, and $y$ point towards arrays containing the coefficient, input, and output, respectively. As for the functions body, the first for-loop initializes the taps while the second for-loop goes through all of the inputs and shifts them onto the taps and computes their impulse response.

Looking at the C code, it seems to be a good representation of the FIR filter. There are however a few problems with the implementation. For instance, the second of the two inner for-loops that calculates the intermediate result $v$ does so by performing a dot-product of the arrays $b$ and $tap$. Implementing a dot-product in this manner does mean it is specialized to our FIR filter, as opposed to a stand-alone function which can be used by many. While it is possible to extract the computation like so:

\begin{code}
double dot(int N, double *xs, double *ys)
{
  double sum = 0;
  for (int i=0; i<N; i++) sum += xs[i] * ys[i];
  return sum;
}
\end{code}

\noindent The function is still specialized to values of type $double$, it assumes $b$ and $tap$ both have at least $N$ elements, and it is not readily compositional since the function cannot be merged with the producers of \codei{xs} or \codei{ys} without looking at its implementation.

In Haskell, functions like the dot-product can be implemented in a compositional style by using two operations from its standard libraries, namely \codei{zipWith} and \codei{sum}:

\begin{code}
dot :: Num a => [a] -> [a] -> a
dot xs ys = sum (zipWith (*) xs ys)
\end{code}

\noindent \codei{zipWith} is a general function for merging lists and is used here to combine the input lists \codei{xs} and \codei{ys} by element wise multiplication. The resulting list is summed together with the help of \codei{sum}, which produces the final result of the dot-product. In contrast to the C function which only accepts values of type \codei{double}, \codei{dot} is able to take any numerical value thanks to its \codei{Num} constraint on \codei{a}. Furthermore, Haskell's lazy evaluation ensures that \codei{dot} can be merged freely with the producers of \codei{xs} and \codei{ys}.

% \codei{zipWith} is a general, list-based function and can used with other operators than simply multiplication

% We also define two additional helper functions, namely the \codei{shift} and \codei{step} functions:

%\begin{code}
%push :: a -> [a] -> [a]
%push x taps = x : init taps
%
%step :: [a] -> [a] -> a -> ([a], a)
%step b taps x = (new, dot b new)
%  where new = push x taps
%\end{code}

%\noindent \codei{shift} is designed to manage the filter's taps, as it pushes a new value onto them while at the same time dropping their oldest value. \codei{step} shifts the current input onto the taps and then calculates the output for that time instant, returning a pair of the taps and impulse response.

%We can now implement the FIR filter:

%\begin{code}
%fir :: Num a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
%fir b xs = snd (mapAccumR (step b) taps xs)
%  where
%    taps = replicate (length b) 0
%\end{code}

%The filter uses a special mapping function, called \codei{mapAccumR}, which is similar to the earlier \codei{map} function show in section~\ref{functional}, but also carries around an extra value throughout its applications of \codei{step} to the inputs \codei{xs}. For the filter, this extra value is used to hold the filter's taps. The taps are initially a list of zeroes created by Haskell's \codei{replicate} function, and each application of \codei{step} pushes an new input onto the taps. The result of the filter is obtained using \codei{snd}, which throws away the taps and returns only the accumulated outputs.

Implementing the dot product as an embedded function in our co-design library is not that different from its implementation in standard Haskell. In fact, we can reimplement the dot product without having to change its definition very much at all:

\begin{code}
dot :: (Num a, Type a) => Vec (Exp a) -> Vec (Exp a) -> Exp a
dot xs ys = sum (zipWith (*) xs ys)
\end{code}

\noindent Its type has grown a bit, and it is perhaps the clearest indicator of how things have changed. Gone are the regular Haskell lists and values, and in their place we have the vector and expression types \codei{Vec} and \codei{Exp}, respectively. These types provide functions that mimic common operations in Haskell. For example, a vector can be thought of as description of a list of finite size, while expressions can be thought of as a pure computation that models a regular Haskell value---like the deeply embedded expressions from section~\ref{domain}.

% These types are part of our co-design library

%The latter analogy is especially appropritate, as it is in fact possible to evaluate expressions into their equivalent value in Haskell:

%\begin{code}
%evaluateExp :: Type a => Exp a -> a
%\end{code}

%\noindent That is, as long as its an expression over some known type \codei{a} which supports evaluation. This extra type constraint is enforced by the \codei{Type} class and ensures \codei{a} is known type---such as a boolean or a numeric type.

The vector type and its functions are part of the user-facing libraries of the co-design library, and provides a nice syntax for writing array based functions. At its core however, the co-design library is built on a representation imperative programs to model the kind of programs written in C and VHDL. For this reason, the co-design library also provide types for references, arrays, and other common types found in both C and VHDL.

Implementing the full FIR filter in an imperative style with our co-design library is done by using on of its program types. With the help of Haskell's do-syntax, which functions to be written as a series of steps to take, the filter can be implemented using a program type like so:

\begin{code}
fir :: (Num a, Type a) => Int -> Arr a -> Arr a -> Prog (Arr a)
fir N b xs = do
  taps <- initArr (replicate N 0)
  ys   <- initArr (replicate (length xs) 0)
  for 0 L $ \ix -> do
    for 1 (lit N) $ \jx -> do
      tmp <- getArr taps (jx - 1)
      setArr taps jx tmp
    x <- getArr xs ix
    setArr taps 0 x
    setArr ys ix (dot b taps)
  return ys
\end{code}

\noindent Notice that $N$, the filters rank, is a pure Haskell value as opposed to an expression. As regular Haskell values are evaluated before a program is compiled, the filter function is actually a kind of generator that produces a specialized filter for each value of $N$. The filter's array operations is supported by the \codei{Arr} type, which provides the \codei{initArr}, \codei{getArr}, and \codei{setArr} functions for managing the creation, indexing, and writing to arrays.

%Text.

%\begin{code}
%fir :: (Num a, Type a) => Int -> Arr a -> Arr a -> Design (Arr a)
%fir N b xs = do
%  taps <- initArr (replicate N 0)
%  ys   <- initArr (replicate (length xs) 0)
%  for 1 (lit N) $ \jx -> do
%    tmp <- getArr taps (jx - 1)
%    setArr taps jx tmp
%  x <- getArr xs ix
%  setArr taps 0 x
%  setArr ys ix (dot b taps)
%  return ys
%\end{code}

%\subsubsection{Interpretations}

%Evaluating an expression to its equivalent Haskell value is not the only supported interpretation of expressions. In fact, we could just as well have compiled the same expression to, say, its corresponding C code. The ability to interpret \codei{Exp} in multiple ways comes from the fact that its a deeply embedded type; operations over \codei{Exp} build an interim data structure that describes the expression. For instance, an expression like \codei{a * b} could result in an abstract syntax tree of \codei{Mult (Var ``a'') (Var ``b'')}, representing the multiplication of the two variables \codei{a} and \codei{b}. A Syntax tree like this one is what enables the compiler to inspect, modify, and interpret an expression in order to support, for example, its compilation into source code or evaluation.

%For the case of evaluating an expression, if we assume the \codei{Exp} is defined as:

%\begin{code}
%data Exp a = Var String | Lit a | Mult (Exp a) (Exp a)
%\end{code}

%\noindent that is, expressions contain three constructors for variables, literals, and multiplication---Haskell's \codei{data} keyword introduces a new type and its constructors are separated by a pipe---then its evaluation can be defined like so:

%\begin{code}
%evaluateExp :: Type a => Exp a -> a
%evaluateExp (Var v)    = error "open expression."
%evaluateExp (Lit i)    = i
%evaluateExp (Mult a b) = (evaluateExp a) * (evaluateExp b)
%\end{code}

%\noindent Each line of \codei{evaluateExp} handles one of the three constructors and translates them into their corresponding Haskell value. The one exception in this translation is variables, since they cannot be translated without knowing the context in which the expression is evaluated---we simply don't know what value it references. As a result, trying to evaluate an expression that contains open variables will yield an error.

%\subsubsection{Vectors}

%The similarities between the implementation of the embedded and regular dot-products are mostly superficial. This is because, the helper functions used in the embedded variant are not the standard Haskell functions for lists, but rather functions provided by our vector library that share the same names:

%\begin{code}
%data Vec a = Vec (Exp Length) (Exp Index -> Exp a)

%zipWith :: (Type a, Type b)
%  => (Exp a -> Exp b -> Exp c)
%  ->  Vec a -> Vec b -> Vec c
%zipWith f a b = map (uncurry f) (zip a b)

%sum :: (Num a, Type a) => Vec a -> Exp a
%sum a = fold (+) 0 a
%\end{code}

%\noindent where both \codei{zipWith} and \codei{sum} are defined with the help of other vector functions.

%What's interesting about vectors is that they're defined in terms of a regular Haskell data type with two components: a length, given by the expression \codei{Exp Length}; and an indexing function \codei{(Exp Index -> a)} that, given an index of type \codei{Exp Index}, looks up the value \codei{a} of the vector. \codei{Index} and \codei{Length} are both integer types in disguise that have been renamed to make them more descriptive.

%Its no coincident that the definition of vectors is similar to their semantics, as \codei{Vec} is an example of a shallowly embedded data type and the very idea of its representation is to model the operations that can be performed on vectors. This characteristic of shallow embeddings makes it easy to add new functions, but it also makes them difficult to interpret in any way other than the intended one. It is because of this deficiency that vectors are based on the deeply embedded \codei{Exp} type; evaluating \codei{Vec} turns it into one big expression which can then be interpreted.

%Compiling the embedded dot-product to C yields the following code:

%\begin{code}
%-- todo: compile dot-product to C and past code here.
%\end{code}

\end{document}
