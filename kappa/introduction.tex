\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}

\todo{Read this.}

Embedded systems are, in brief, any computer system that is part of a larger system but relies on its own microprocessor. It is embeddde as part of a larger machine to sovle a particular task, and often does so under memory and real-time constraints. Embedded systems have been have been around for decades, and still control many devices in common use today~\cite{barr2006}. For example, modern cars contain a number of embedded systems, each controlling a small function of the car; one system might control the brakes, while another displays information to the dashboard. In most cases, these embedded sub-systems are all connected together in a network. 

Developing software for embedded systems, in most cases, requires good knowledge about the hardware on which the software is supposed to run. Because embedded systems are typically designed with a task in mind, their hardware systems are often built with most cost-effective processor that meets the performance requirements. So developers must ensure their computations are efficient. Every line of code counts.

As important as computational power is for embedded systems, limiting their power consumption presents an equally important issue in their architectural design~\cite{mudge2001}. The trend of trading power for performance cannot continue indefinitely: typical house hold processors of today have a power density of 70W and upwards, which is seven times that of a typical hot plate. Containing the growth in power requires architectural improvements, with specialized computing for specialized tasks. Heterogeneous computing represents an interesting development towards the goal of energy efficient computing, and refers to systems that use more than one kind of processing units. These heterogeneous systems gain their performance and energy efficiency not just by combining several processors, but rather by incorporating different kinds of co-processors that provide specialized processing capabilities to handle a particular task.

Heterogeneous computing present new challenges in software design that are not found in the development for typical homogeneous systems~\cite{kunzman2011}. The multiple processing units present in a heterogeneous system raises all of the issues associated with homogeneous parallel systems, while the heterogeneity in the system gives rise to new issues due to  dissimilarity in system development and capability. The efficiency and computational power of heterogeneous systems thus comes at a cost of increased programming burden in terms of code complexity and portability, as hardware specific code is interleaved with application code to handle any communication between co-processors. Furthermore, the structure of application code typically vary between co-processors and any code written for one therefore requires modification when given a new target. In fact, despite all the advantages heterogeneous systems offer, their use so far has been mostly restricted to hardware programmers.

A substantial amount of research has gone into addressing the challenges of programming for embedded heterogeneous systems, opening them up for programmers without a background in hardware or embedded system design. However, hardware description languages, such as VHDL and Verilog, are still the most commonly used tools, together with C for specific co-processors. These hardware description languages have revolutionized hardware design but suffer from a lack of expressiveness and standardization -- there is a mismatch between description and synthesized hardware. Designers have therefore looked for alternative solutions, where one of the more well-known approaches is synthesis of high-level languages like C~\cite{graphics2008, ghenassia2005}. Compiling high-level languages to a hardware description has great appeal, but finding a translation between the two has however proven to be difficult; sequential programs are often a bad fit for the parallelism inherent to most hardware architectures.

Another group of languages whom I believe have shown success in describing hardware designs are functional languages~\cite{sheeran2005}. Higher-order functional languages in particular, where hardware descriptions are first-class objects, offer a particularly useful abstraction mechanism~\cite{baaij2010, bjesse1998, gill2010}. Another beneficial attribute of these languages is their purity, which enables reasoning about function (de-)composition. That is, functional programming separates the definition and evaluation of its functions, and functions could, for example, be run in parallel, as long as their dependencies are covered. Functional languages are however rarely considered for embedded system development, as its difficult to give performance guarantees and resource bounds for its programs.

This thesis presents the first steps towards a functional programming language intended for embedded system development, where the entire design process of heterogeneous systems can be expressed. The language aims to go further than the aforementioned functional languages, and does not rely solely on hardware descriptions; some components are better described using sequential algorithms directly, rather than having one generated from a hardware description.

This thesis consists of two parts. Part I is a general introduction to the field and puts the appended papers into context. Part II contains the appended papers.
