\firstabstract{
Developing software for embedded systems presents quite the challenge; not only does embedded system demand good knowledge of the hardware they run on, but also demand efficiency under tight resource constraints. Modern embedded systems gain their performance from combining several kinds of co-processors, where each processor provides specialized processing capabilities to handle a particular task. Their efficiency does however come at a cost of increased complexity: co-processor specific code is interleaved with regular software code and hardware for the communication between co-processors.

In this thesis we explore a functional approach to embedded systems development through our hardware software co-design language and its associated vector and signal processing libraries. We argue that a functional approach can address many of the modularity problems of embedded system development, which are typically programmed in low-level languages. Particularly the glue code that functional languages offer, through its higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, enables us to build useful combinators. These features makes it easy to explore software and hardware designs in a way that traditional languages would have found difficult.

Low-level languages are mainly considered for embedded system due to the fine control they give over a system's capabilities, whereas functional languages are typically unaware of any resource constraints they operate under. We therefore consider explicit memory control and a staged compilation scheme for our functional languages, that is, a series of translations between progressively smaller languages, with the aim of giving designers better control over the generated source code.

\acknowledgements{
To my dearest, my fianc\'ee Emma Bogren: because I owe it all to you.

My constant cheerleaders, that is, my parents Dag and Lena: I am forever grateful for your moral and emotional support, you were always keen to know what I was doing and how I was proceeding. Although I'm fairly certain you never fully grasped what my work was all about, you never wavered in your encouragement and enthusiastic inquires. I am also grateful to my sibling Caroline who have supported me along the way, and her wonderful dog Alfons whom never failed to brighten my day.

A very special gratitude goes out to my advisor Mary Sheeran, for your continuous help and support in my studies, for your never ending patience, guidance and immense knowledge. With a special mention to my former co-worker Emil Axelsson, without your precious support I would not have been able to conduct my research. I will always miss our interesting and long-lasting chats.

I am also grateful to Anders Persson, Josef Svenningsson and Koen Claesson for their unfailing support and assistance. Your hard work, ideas and insights in the Feldspar project have proved a great source of inspiration in my research. Finally I express my gratitude to all my other colleagues at Chalmers, who make this a fantastic place to work.

Thank you all for your encouragement!

\paperwork{
Paper A introduces my signal processing language and an early version of our compilation techniques. I am the lead author but Emil Axelsson wrote the majority of section 3.1 and 3.2. The paper was rewarded the Peter Landin award for best paper at the \textit{International Symposium on Implementation and Applications of Functional Languages, IFL 2014}

Paper B introduces my hardware software co-design language and a mature version of our compiler and representation of imperative programs. The techniques presented are however not restricted to hardware software co-design, and can be of use for developers of embedded languages in general. I am the lead author.
