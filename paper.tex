\firstabstract{
Developing software for embedded systems presents quite the challenge; not only does embedded system demand good knowledge of the hardware they run on, but also demand efficiency under tight resource constraints. A modern FPGA shows great promise as a prototypical system for heterogeneous embedded computing. In exchange their benefits, the combination of a FPGA's hardware and software components makes the already difficult task of programming for embedded systems harder still.

This thesis explores a functional approach to embedded systems development through a hardware software co-design language embedded in Haskell. A functional approach can address many of the modularity problems of heterogeneous system development, which are typically programmed in low-level languages. Furthermore, the co-design language serves as a compilation target for a signal processing and vector library that introduces useful abstractions.

Low-level languages are mainly considered for embedded system due to the fine control they give over a system's capabilities. The co-design language therefore has explicit memory control and a staged compilation scheme, that is, compilation is a series of translations to progressively smaller languages. This approach gives a designer control over the generated source code, more so than is typically had in a lazy functional language. The techniques presented in this thesis are however not limited to hardware software co-design, as it is based on a monadic representation of imperative programs that is loosely coupled to its expression and predicate types. As such, the techniques are usable to library designers looking to model other, imperative languages.

\acknowledgements{
To my dearest, my fianc\'ee Emma Bogren: because I owe it all to you.

My constant cheerleaders, that is, my parents Dag and Lena: I am forever grateful for your moral and emotional support, you were always keen to know what I was doing and how I was proceeding. Although I'm fairly certain you never fully grasped what my work was all about, you never wavered in your encouragement and enthusiastic inquires. I am also grateful to my sibling Caroline who have supported me along the way, and her wonderful dog Alfons whom never failed to brighten my day.

A very special gratitude goes out to my advisor Mary Sheeran, for your continuous help and support in my studies, for your never ending patience, guidance and immense knowledge. With a special mention to my former co-worker Emil Axelsson, without your precious support I would not have been able to conduct my research. I will always miss our interesting and long-lasting chats.

I am also grateful to Anders Persson, Josef Svenningsson and Koen Claesson for their unfailing support and assistance. Your hard work, ideas and insights in the Feldspar project have proved a great source of inspiration in my research. Finally I express my gratitude to all my other colleagues at Chalmers, who make this a fantastic place to work.

Thank you all for your encouragement!

\paperwork{
Paper A introduces my signal processing language and an early version of our compilation techniques. I am the lead author but Emil Axelsson wrote the majority of sections 3.1 and 3.2. The paper was awarded the Peter Landin award for best paper at the \textit{International Symposium on Implementation and Applications of Functional Languages, IFL 2014}

Paper B introduces my hardware software co-design language and a mature version of our compiler and representation of imperative programs. The techniques presented are however not restricted to hardware software co-design, and can be of use for developers of embedded languages in general. I am the lead author.
