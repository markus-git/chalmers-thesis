\firstabstract{
Developing software for embedded systems presents quite the challenge---not only do these systems demand good knowledge of the hardware they run on, but their limited resources also make it difficult to achieve efficiency. For embedded systems with different kinds of processing elements, the challenge is even greater; the presence of heterogeneous elements both raises all of the issues associated with homogeneous systems, and may also cause non-uniform system development and capability. Still, these systems are able to achieve good energy efficiency and performance by incorporating specialized processing units.

In this thesis we explore a functional approach to heterogeneous system development, with a staged hardware software co-design language embedded in Haskell, to address many of the modularity problems typically found in such systems. This staged approach enables designers to build their applications from reusable components and skeletons, while retaining control over much of the generated source code. Design exploration also benefits from the functional approach, since Haskell's type classes can be used to ensure that certain operations will be available. As a result, a developer can not only write for hardware and software in the co-design language, but she can also write generic programs that are suitable for both.

Internally, the co-design language is based on a monadic representation of imperative programs that abstracts away from its underlying statement, expression, and predicate types by establishing an interface to their respective interpreters. Programs are thus loosely coupled to its underlying types, giving a clear separation of concerns. The compilation process is expressed as a series of translations between progressively smaller typed languages, which safeguards against many common errors.

In addition to the hardware software co-design, this thesis also introduces a language for expressing digital signal processing algorithms, using a model of synchronous data-flow that is embedded in Haskell. The language supports definitions in a functional style, reducing the gap between an algorithm's mathematical specification and its implementation. A vector language is also presented, which builds on a functional representation that guarantees fusion for arrays. Both of these languages are intended to be extensions of the co-design language, but neither one is dependent on it and can thus be used to extend other languages as well.

\acknowledgements{
To my dearest, my fianc\'ee Emma Bogren: because I owe it all to you.

My constant cheerleaders, that is, my parents Dag and Lena: I am forever grateful for your moral and emotional support, you were always keen to know what I was doing and how I was proceeding. Although I'm fairly certain you never fully grasped what my work was all about, you never wavered in your encouragement and enthusiastic inquires. I am also grateful to my sibling Caroline who have supported me along the way, and her wonderful dog Alfons whom never failed to brighten my day.

A very special gratitude goes out to my advisor Mary Sheeran, for your continuous help and support in my studies, for your never ending patience, guidance and immense knowledge. With a special mention to my former co-worker Emil Axelsson, without your precious support I would not have been able to conduct my research. I will always miss our interesting and long-lasting chats.

I am also grateful to Anders Persson, Josef Svenningsson and Koen Claesson for their unfailing support and assistance. Your hard work, ideas and insights in the Feldspar project have proved a great source of inspiration in my research. Finally I express my gratitude to all my other colleagues at Chalmers, who make this a fantastic place to work.

Thank you all for your encouragement!

\paperwork{
Paper A introduces my signal processing language and an early version of our compilation techniques. I am the lead author but Emil Axelsson wrote the majority of sections 3.1 and 3.2. The paper was awarded the Peter Landin award for best paper at the \textit{International Symposium on Implementation and Applications of Functional Languages, IFL 2014}

Paper B introduces my hardware software co-design language and a mature version of our compiler and representation of imperative programs. The techniques presented are however not restricted to hardware software co-design, and can be of use for developers of embedded languages in general. I am the lead author.
